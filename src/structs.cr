# Implements 256-bit `Secp256k1` Koblitz elliptic curve.
# Ref: [secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf](https://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf)
#
# `Secp256k1` has the characteristic prime `p`, it is defined over the prime field â„¤_p.

  # Properties:
  # * `x` (`BigInt`): the position on the x-axis.
  # * `y` (`BigInt`): the position on the y-axis.
  #
  # ```
  # P = EC_Point.new BigInt.new(0), BigInt.new(0)
  # p.x # => 0
  # p.y # => 0
  # ```
